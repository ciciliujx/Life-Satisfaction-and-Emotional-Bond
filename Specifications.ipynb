    "The first specification aligns with out initial model excluding the control variable. The coefficients are significant except those for the interaction terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the second specification, we dropped the interaction terms. From here, as the degree of disagreement to the statement \"having emotional bonds with at least one person\" increases, the coefficient on life satisfaction decreases with statistical significance. This holds true across specifications, indicating that the perception of emotional bonds with others is highly likely to be positively correlated to the satisfaction with life in general. What's more, the coefficient values ($\\hat{\\beta_{1, 1}} = -0.50, \\hat{\\beta_{1, 2}} = -1.37, \\hat{\\beta_{1, 3}} = -2.89$) are relatively large in a 0-10 scale, meaning the emotional bonds might be an essential element that affects life satisfaction. This answers part of our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the coefficient of age on life satisfaction ($\\hat{\\beta_2} = -0.004$) is statistically significant. Though the absolute value is small, a very small standard error ($se = 0.001$) indicates the effect of age on life satisfaction does not vary much across data. The coefficient presents that the life satisfaction has minor decrease in unit increase in age.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third specification, we add sex as the control variable into the regression equation. The coefficient (-0.001) is very small and not statistically significant. It also does not affect the estimates for coefficients of our main interest, suggesting the effects of emotional bonds and age on life satisfaction do not differ in sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourth specification, we have the living condition as the control variable in the model. As they are included, the absolute values of coefficients of emotional bond on life satisfaction slightly decrease, and the standard errors almost hold constant, compared to specification two. However, the coefficient on age changes from -0.004 to -0.001 and is insignificant. This may suggest that living condition accounts most of the effect of age on life satisfaction. However, since we derive the variable of the living condition from the original variable \"family arrangement,\" it should be careful of its features. The levels of the original variable contain information of the age group (e.g., living condition of \"parent\" and \"children\"). This may disturb the investigation."
